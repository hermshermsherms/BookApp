# BookApp — Product Requirements Document

> **Status:** v1 MVP — Discovery Feed Complete, UI/UX Polished
> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-14

---

## 1. Overview

An iOS app for book discovery and reading tracking. Two core experiences:

1. **Discovery** — A full-screen, TikTok-style swipeable feed of book recommendations
2. **Logging** — A personal library of liked/read books with review capabilities

User accounts (via Apple Sign In) power personalization across both.

## 3. Discovery Page

### Interaction Model
| Gesture | Action | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Swipe up | Next book | Smooth transition to next book (TikTok-style) |
| Swipe down | Previous book | Smooth transition to previous book (Instagram Reels-style) |
| Double tap | Like | Saves to Library → "Want to Read" + heart animation |
| Single tap | Details | Opens scrollable detail view with optimized action buttons |
| Buy button | Purchase | Shows purchase sheet with in-app browser links |

**Note:** Swipe left/right gestures were removed in favor of cleaner vertical-only navigation for optimal feed experience.

### Card Content (full-screen)
- **High-quality book cover image** with smart fallback hierarchy:
  1. High-resolution cover from Google Books API
  2. Thumbnail fallback if high-res unavailable
  3. Genre-specific styled title card with gradients and icons
- Title (serif typography) + Author
- Genre tag with accent styling
- Average rating (star icon) + page count
- One-line hook / description snippet
- Smooth animations and transitions throughout

### Detail View (single tap)
Scrollable overlay/sheet showing:
- Book cover (large, high-quality)
- Title, author, genre, page count, publication date
- Full synopsis / description
- Author info snippet
- **Skip, Save, Buy buttons** (positioned above similar books for better UX)
- Similar books (horizontal scroll with improved image quality)

### Purchase Sheet (Buy button)
Bottom sheet with purchase options:
- Amazon (with cart icon and orange branding)
- Apple Books (with book icon and blue branding)
- Bookshop.org (with building columns icon and positive branding)
- **Links open in smooth in-app Safari browser** with proper delegate handling for seamless navigation

### Feed Logic (v1 — pre-recommendation engine)
- Popular/trending books from Google Books API

- Exclude books user has already seen (liked or disliked)
- Pre-fetch next 5–10 books for smooth swiping

---

## 4. Logging Page (Library)

### Layout
- **Three tabs:** Want to Read | Reading | Read
- Each tab: scrollable list sorted by date added (most recent first)
- Each row: cover thumbnail, title, author, status indicator

### Book Status Flow
```
Want to Read → Reading → Read
```
- Users can move books between statuses freely
- Books arrive in "Want to Read" from Discovery (like or buy)

### Reviews
- Available when a book is marked as "Read"
- **Rating:** 1–5 stars, full stars only (tap to rate)
- **Text review:** Open text input, no character limit
- Reviews are editable and deletable

### Manual Book Add
- Search bar at top of Library that queries Google Books API
- User can search by title or author
- Add result to any status tab

---

## 5. Accounts & Auth

### Authentication
- **Apple Sign In** only (privacy-friendly, App Store compliant)
- Supabase Auth handles session management
- Account required to use the app (no guest mode for v1)

### Profile Tab
- Display name (from Apple ID)
- Reading stats: books read, reviews written, total books in library
- Settings: account management, delete account (required by App Store)

---

## 6. Design

### Visual Style
- **Light, warm, bookish** — indie bookstore aesthetic
- Cream / warm paper background tones
- Serif fonts for book titles, clean sans-serif for UI text
- Book covers as the primary visual element
- Subtle, smooth animations (native iOS feel, not flashy)

### Navigation
- **Bottom tab bar** with 3 tabs:

  - 📚 Library
  - 👤 Profile

---

## 7. Monetization (v1)

- **Free app** with affiliate revenue from book purchases
- Affiliate links in purchase sheet (Amazon Associates, Apple Books affiliate)
- No ads, no premium tier for v1

---

## 8. Data Model (Supabase)

### Tables
- **users** — id, apple_id, display_name, created_at
- **user_books** — id, user_id, google_books_id, status (want_to_read / reading / read), added_at, updated_at
- **reviews** — id, user_id, google_books_id, rating (1-5), review_text, created_at, updated_at
- **swipe_history** — id, user_id, google_books_id, action (like / dislike / buy), swiped_at

### Key Indexes
- user_books: (user_id, status) for tab filtering
- swipe_history: (user_id, google_books_id) for feed deduplication

## 13. Implementation Best Practices

### **Lessons Learned from Initial Implementation**

**❌ What NOT to do:**
- **Don't create scaffolding without functionality** - Empty view files with placeholder content provide no user value
- **Don't claim features are "implemented" when they're just structured** - Users care about working functionality, not architecture
- **Don't build everything at once** - This leads to nothing being fully functional
- **Don't skip testing each feature** - Untested features often have basic issues that block user flows

**✅ What TO do:**
- **Implement one complete user flow at a time** - Users should be able to complete a full journey (e.g., discover → view → save a book)
- **Start with core functionality, not polish** - Get the basic feature working before adding animations or perfect styling  
- **Test each milestone thoroughly** - Ensure the feature works end-to-end before moving to the next
- **Use real data as early as possible** - Mock data is fine temporarily, but integrate real APIs quickly
- **Focus on user experience over technical architecture** - A working app with less perfect code is better than perfect code that doesn't work

### **Milestone Success Criteria**
Each milestone should meet these criteria before moving to the next:
- ✅ **Functionally complete** - All described user actions work
- ✅ **Tested end-to-end** - Full user flow verified manually
- ✅ **No placeholder content** - Real data displayed to users
- ✅ **Error handling** - Basic error states handled gracefully
- ✅ **Commits and documentation** - Changes committed with clear descriptions

### **Implementation Order Principles**
1. **Start with the most valuable user flow** (Discovery feed for this app)
2. **Build vertically, not horizontally** (Complete one feature fully vs partial implementation across features)
3. **Integrate external dependencies early** (APIs, authentication) to surface integration issues
4. **Polish comes last** (Visual design and animations after functionality works)
